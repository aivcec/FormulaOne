# Formula One

Small iOS app showing 2017 formula One drivers.

The app was built using VIPER pattern and .xib files for user interface.

The app requires Facebook login, but only stores user information locally.

This app was made using my own [FormulaAPI](https://github.com/aivcec/FormulaAPI), as well as a number of other pods.
